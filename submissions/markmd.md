# Hackathon Submission: mark.md

## Project Description

mark.md is a web tool that allows users to extract clean Markdown, HTML, or plain text from any website.
It solves the problem of messy copy-paste using traditional methods (like Ctrl + C), where copied content often includes unwanted UI elements — especially on documentation sites such as Appwrite Docs or Supabase Docs.

With mark.md, documentation becomes easier to reuse, read, and integrate into LLMs or other developer workflows.
Users can instantly export website content into structured formats, improving accuracy, accessibility, and productivity.

## Inspiration behind the Project

Most documentation sites today don’t offer export options like Markdown, HTML, or plain text.
This makes copying or reusing docs difficult and time-consuming.

For both open-source and private projects, adding export support for every page (Markdown, HTML, XML, JSON, etc.) takes too much effort and maintenance.
Also, while the Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to make data accessible to AI tools, it’s not yet common across sites.

mark.md solves this by giving a universal, no-setup solution — it can instantly extract and export any webpage into developer-friendly formats without needing direct integration or MCP support.

## Tech Stack
